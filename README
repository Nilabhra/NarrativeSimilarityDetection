# NarrativeSimilarityDetection

This is an initial attemt to create a similarity detection engine which in the future may help doctors in treating patients, the details are explained as follows:

GOAL: For a given input patient narrative written by a doctor (language is English strictly for now), the output should be three existing patient narratives which are most similar to the input.

IMPLEMENTATIONAL DETAILS: For now the engine has a bareback web based UI consisting of a single html page and a servlet. For a given input, the Lin score of the input is calculated will the entire database. The 3 narratives that have the maximum score are displayed in order of their ranks. A library called the ws4j is used for calculating the lin score, it returns a matrix for each narrative hence all the values in the matrix are added up and then the sum is divided by the sum of the dimentions of the matrix. The database of choice is MongoDb as it supports very fast read operations and is specially designed for storing textual content. When the server is first started, it fetches all the data from the British Medical Journal and stores it into the document base. The database can be refreshed by manually deleting all the entries and then restarting the server.

INSTALLATION NOTES: It is recommended to use a server that supports Java 7 and above. The code is strictly written to be used with MongoDb 3.0.2 and above using the latest Java driver. The database name is 'narratives' and the collection name for now is 'demo'. For handling JSON data the package at www.json.org/java is used.

A working implementation is running at: http://128.199.80.218:8080/demo/
